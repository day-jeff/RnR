# CSE PO Accountabilities – What and How?

[This section describes the core accountabilities of the CSE PO Role. These are intended to be used by Lead POs and Shadow POs as a basis for constructive feedback and coaching in the course of engagements.]

1. Stakeholder Management

- Identifies and appropriately shares information on “who’s who” in the engagement, including stakeholders who are not at the table but probably should be.
- Clearly communicates the value, success factors and “ground rules” of our code-with engagement model and successfully enlists customer stakeholders to work with Microsoft within this framework.
- Establishes clarity up front around roles and responsibilities to minimize conflicts or gaps in the ownership model during the engagement.
- Understands the different roles and accountabilities of Microsoft representatives and appropriately leverages opportunities for internal, cross-team partnership.
- Drives transparent and inclusive communication on the project team and with all stakeholders. Exercises maturity and diplomacy in handling any organizational tensions, interpersonal conflicts or other communication issues that might arise.
- Actively manages expectations across all project participants to avoid misunderstandings that could undermine trust, generate waste or block progress.

2. Scoping: Problem, Success & Done

- Facilitates creation of precise, implementation-free problem statements that capture the essential challenges to be overcome and the resulting core value to be delivered for the customer’s business and/or Microsoft.
- Facilitates development of unambiguous success criteria that establish a common view of desired project outcomes and a common “yardstick” for determining whether or how well those outcomes have been achieved.
- Facilitates definition of done for each milestone (as epics/user stories with accompanying acceptance criteria) that delivers a meaningful increment of value on the path to project success while also reducing project unknowns and risk.

3. Backlog Management

- Ensures use of persona in a consistent way to capture the desired experience for all relevant user types including developer, system admin, app admin, end user, etc.
- Understands target users at sufficient depth to capture not just the desired experience but the added value that the desired experience should deliver for them.
- [User Stories: right granularity]
- [User Stories: clear purpose]
- Identifies and respects the boundary between user experience (TPM primary concern) and implementation (Tech Lead primary concern) while working collaboratively with devs to ensure that the two remain well aligned.  Understands how different implementation choices can impact user experience and works proactively with devs to ensure such impacts are considered in the design.
- Demonstrates ability to drive engineering fundamentals through specification of the desired customer experiences that depend on them.
- [Backlog Management: complete, up-to-date, prioritized, vital as primary vehicle for task management and status reporting]
- Adjusts backlog management approach to different agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) as appropriate for the engineering team and customer context. 

4. Risk Management

- [Make sure this has a sufficiently technical cast.  A PO can’t manage risks s/he doesn’t understand or is not able to spot without being told by devs.  CSE POs need to be able to proactively identify engineering risks, especially those that impact the desired user experience.  This includes risks that arise from engineering fundamentals and impact things like the maintainability, interoperability, scalability, reliability, etc.  See bullet in section 3 above on using user stories to drive the right investments into engineering fundamentals.]
- [CSE POs need to proactively spot and accurately assess the severity/likelihood of different types of risk, understand the available approaches to mitigation and have an informed opinion as to which may be most suitable given the circumstances.  They need to communicate with stakeholders, motivate the team to take appropriate action, and be independently able to assess whether that action has been completed to the degree necessary to mitigate the risk.]

5. Product Management: Sharing & Reuse Plan

- [Qualifying reuse opportunities, planning and executing collaborative work to develop and deliver on the most worthwhile among those opportunities.  Key will be to articulate the specific expertise that this requires not just the process steps to complete.]
- [Identifying patterns.  Technical understanding to spot the general pattern in the specific case.  Developer experience and software industry know-how to correctly and accurately identify the broader need that the pattern addresses.]
- [Right scenario granularity.  Ability to articulate who has that need and what they have in common (identifying the market segment) versus scenario elements that might be specific to different industries or use cases and therefore better included as part of a “scenario variant” as opposed the core pattern.]
- [Pragmatism.  Hypothesis-driven development.  Discerning what is actionable now given what we can validate with existing customers/real demand versus what is speculative and might be better saved for a future phase when we have a clearer signal on the need.]
- [Product leadership.  Ability to develop influence through data and insights, to enlist engineering teams across the organization to contribute.  Understanding what other teams might be able and inherently motivated/interested to do.  Building the required partnerships (internally and externally to Microsoft) to achieve reuse at a scale that’s necessary to drive meaningful efficiency gains or impact on adoption.]
