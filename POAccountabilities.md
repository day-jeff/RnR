# CSE PO Accountabilities – What and How?

This following content describes the core accountabilities for a CSE Product Owner Role. This content is intended to clarify the PO role for everyone in CSE, and it also provides a framework for Lead POs to provide constructive feedback and coaching to Shadow POs.

**1. Stakeholder Management**

- **One Microsoft:** Assure that all Microsoft teams, including the account teams and different groups from within CSE, are fully aligned before the first meeting/conversation with the customer so that the customer has a unified, One Microsoft experience from the start of the Dev Crews involvement in the project.

- **Stakeholders and decision makers:** Identify and communicate with the rest of the project team “who’s who” for the engagement, including stakeholders who are not at the table but probably should be. The stakeholders list must include the customer contacts who can confirm that the proposed success criteria are aligned with the customer's business goals.
- **CSE Engagement Model:** In partnership with the SEI and tech lead, assure that the account team and customer's decision makers understand the value, success factors and “ground rules” for CSE's code-with engagement model and are prepared to work Microsoft within this framework.
- **Roles & responsibilities:** Establish clarity up front around project roles and responsibilities, across both Microsoft and the customer, to minimize conflicts or gaps in the ownership model during the engagement.
- **Communication:** Drive transparent and inclusive communication within the project team and with all stakeholders. Exercise maturity and diplomacy in handling organizational tensions, interpersonal conflicts or other communication issues that might arise.
- **Expectations:** Actively manage expectations across all project participants to avoid misunderstandings that could undermine trust, generate waste or block progress.

**2. Scoping: Problem, Success & Done**

- **Problem statement/** Propose, review and obtain full agreeement from the project decision makers a precise, implementation-free problem statement that captures the essential challenges to be delivered for the customer’s business and Microsoft.
- **Success criteria:** Propose, review and obtain full agreeement from the project decision makers unambiguous success criteria that establish a common view of desired project outcomes and a common “yardstick” for determining whether or how well those outcomes have been achieved.
- **Definition of done;** Propose, review and obtain full agreeement from the project decision makers definition of done (aka exit criteria) for each milestone that deliver a meaningful increment of value on the path to project success while also reducing project unknowns and risk.
    
**3. Backlog Management**

- **Personas:** Ensure use of persona in a consistent way to capture the desired experience for all relevant user types including developer, system admin, app admin, end user, etc.
- **Benefits:** Understand target users at sufficient depth to capture not just the desired experience but the added value that the desired experience should deliver for them.
- [User Stories: right granularity]
- [User Stories: clear purpose]
- **Implementation Free:** Identifiy and respecty the boundary between user experience (TPM primary concern) and implementation (Tech Lead primary concern) while working collaboratively with devs to ensure that the two remain well aligned.  Understands how different implementation choices can impact user experience and works proactively with devs to ensure such impacts are considered in the design.
- **Engineering Fundamentals:** Demonstrates ability to drive engineering fundamentals through specification of the desired customer experiences that depend on them.
- **Backlog:** [Backlog Management: complete, up-to-date, prioritized, vital as primary vehicle for task management and status reporting]
- **Adapt to customer:** Adjust backlog management approach to different agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) as appropriate for the engineering team and customer context. 

**4. Risk Management**

- [Make sure this has a sufficiently technical cast.  A PO can’t manage risks s/he doesn’t understand or is not able to spot without being told by devs.  CSE POs need to be able to proactively identify engineering risks, especially those that impact the desired user experience.  This includes risks that arise from engineering fundamentals and impact things like the maintainability, interoperability, scalability, reliability, etc.  See bullet in section 3 above on using user stories to drive the right investments into engineering fundamentals.]
- [CSE POs need to proactively spot and accurately assess the severity/likelihood of different types of risk, understand the available approaches to mitigation and have an informed opinion as to which may be most suitable given the circumstances.  They need to communicate with stakeholders, motivate the team to take appropriate action, and be independently able to assess whether that action has been completed to the degree necessary to mitigate the risk.]

**5. Product Management: Sharing & Reuse Plan**

- [Qualifying reuse opportunities, planning and executing collaborative work to develop and deliver on the most worthwhile among those opportunities.  Key will be to articulate the specific expertise that this requires not just the process steps to complete.]
- [Identifying patterns.  Technical understanding to spot the general pattern in the specific case.  Developer experience and software industry know-how to correctly and accurately identify the broader need that the pattern addresses.]
- [Right scenario granularity.  Ability to articulate who has that need and what they have in common (identifying the market segment) versus scenario elements that might be specific to different industries or use cases and therefore better included as part of a “scenario variant” as opposed the core pattern.]
- [Pragmatism.  Hypothesis-driven development.  Discerning what is actionable now given what we can validate with existing customers/real demand versus what is speculative and might be better saved for a future phase when we have a clearer signal on the need.]
- [Product leadership.  Ability to develop influence through data and insights, to enlist engineering teams across the organization to contribute.  Understanding what other teams might be able and inherently motivated/interested to do.  Building the required partnerships (internally and externally to Microsoft) to achieve reuse at a scale that’s necessary to drive meaningful efficiency gains or impact on adoption.]
