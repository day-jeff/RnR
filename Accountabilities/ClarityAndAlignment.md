# Creating Clarity & Alignment

A Product Owner's most important accountability is assuring that the engagement team has a clear understanding of, and is aligned on, the overall project definition and plan.

## How to achieve clarity & alignment

Typical steps that should be followed to achieve clarity and alignment include: 

- Identify the topic/issue
- Articulate the topic/issue
- Review the topic/issue with the proper stakeholders. 
- Seek agreement that the topic/issue is framed appropriately and otherwise discuss as needed. 
- Help all parties converge on a final decision about how to address/manage the topic.
- Write the decision down, review the language with the relevant stakeholders, and get final buy-in.
