# Presenting as One Microsoft to the Customer

Everyone working on an engagement is expected to deliver a "One Microsoft" experience to customers. It is important that we not confuse or streass customers by exposing them to discontinuities and disagreements between different teams in Microsoft and CSE. With this in mind, we expect teams to get aligned before talking to the customer and to take internal disagreements offline for private discussion.

## Common Issues

- Microsoft folks meet each other for the first time in front of the customer. 
- Information about who's who at he customer, customer expectations, previously completed work, etc. is not shared and understood by all the Microsoft folks.
- There isn't advanced agreement on agenda, who is facilitating the meeting, etc.
- Some or all members the account team haven't worked with CSE and/or a dev crew, and they don't understand our approach, such as code-with, game planning, etc.
- The SEI and/or account team are worried that dev crews folks are going to waste the customer's time and/or make the customer uncomfortable by reviewing topics that have been previously discussed.
- The account team expects and asks CSE&mdash;in front of the customer&mdash;to act in a staff augmentation or support role.
- The account team, SEI and/or dev crew has a disagreement on engagement roles and responsibilities.  

## Recommended Approach

Here are some recommendations on how to provide a One Microsoft Experience for customers.

### Align before meeting the customer
Arrange and lead a discussion between a dev crew and the rest of the engagement team (e.g. the CSA, AEs, SEI, etc.) to understand and clarify:

- Make instroductions and assure that everyone's role (not just title) is understood.
- Account team and SEI explain the work completed and conversations with the customer.
- Assure that everyone understands and is bought into the CSE collaborative project-based approach. 
- Make sure that the account team is not expecting CSE to act in a support or staff aug role. Agree in advance on how to handle such requests if they come up. (Expectation is the account team will bring in MCS and Premier Support as needed. Ask for help from CSE leaders if there is any difficulty getting aligned on these topics.)
- Review and discuss the proposed project, with a focus on the specific scope and outcomes that CSE is being asked to help deliver.
- Discuss who the key stakeholders, focusing especially on decision makers and key influencers, are at the customer.
- Agree on next steps.

### Keep our dirty laundry private

- Avoid talking about different Microsoft teams, such as the account team, CSE, CTE, Dev Crews, MCS, etc. Instead always present yourself and the engagement team as "Microsoft."
- When another team member says something significant to the customer that is incorrect and needs to be corrected, clarify the issue gently and respectfully. Most often, the mistaken party will just say, "Oops, I misspoke."
- If there are more fundamental agreements that require a frank discussion, take the discussion offline. We don't want to show our disagreements to customers.
